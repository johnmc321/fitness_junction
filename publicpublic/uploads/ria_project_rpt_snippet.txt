Under-developed cognitive skills can result in a child having difficulties learning in formal educational (1).  Cognitive skills include a personâ€™s ability to analyse, evaluate, and make deductions, to compare information,  and to determine a course of action depending on the information available.  Puzzles, such as matchstick games, jigsaws, and word games offer a diverting activity for the child and provide a means of developing skills by asking them to assess the problem (what shape or word needs to be found), determine the requirements for a solution, compare possible solutions (two similar pieces of a jigsaw puzzle for example), and retain information learned from one puzzle to the next.
